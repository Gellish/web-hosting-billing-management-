# Lynn Hosting

All features from the hosted app are included in the open-source code. We offer a $20 per year white-label license to remove our branding for personal or business use. More information [here](https://self.lynnhosting.com).

## About

Lynn Hosting is a full featured hosting panel with automated account setup, container deployment, and billing. Web Containers are powered by Docker and Docker PHP, each container is automatically deployed with an SSL certificate provided by Lets Encrypt. Because we use Docker containers, limited terminal access can be given to all users through our Web Terminal. 

# Prerequisites 

Note: you cannot run the panel and server locations on the same server.

To setup the Lynn Hosting Panel or a Server Location you must have root access to a Ubuntu >= 14.04 server with at least 2GB of RAM. We recommend [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/fab9d4a89a58), as they have an easy Cloud Firewall setup and Droplet Volumes.

## Panel Setup

We currently do not have a complete installation guide, to get support on setting up Lynn Hosting please contact [Lynn Digital Support](https://lynndigital.com). Please note, there will be a small setup fee. 

## Server Location Setup

We currently do not have an installation guide, to get support on setting up Lynn Hosting please contact [Lynn Digital Support](https://lynndigital.com). Please note, there will be a small setup fee.

We are currently working on a script to setup Docker and the components necessary for running Lynn Hosting.
